***CPE Certificates of Attendance***

Attendance certificates are usually required by the professional cyber security organisations such as ISC2, ISSA, ISACA  as each time their member attends a seminar 
it qualifies for Continuous Professional Education (CPE) points.
CPE points that members of professional information security associations can earn when participating in different educational activities. 
Each CPE "point" or credit equals one hour of learning activity. 

The benefit is that by accumulating CPE credits, attendees who are members of professional associations can maintain their eligibility to certifications. 

Please note that if you will be giving out Certificates of Attendance you should keep a copy of each certificate and also keep the attendance records (e.g. the attendee list with the names of people who attended ticked off) for a certain period of time (at least 12 months from the event).
